This is simple Mathematica code written for the paper

Improving charge-sensitive biomolecule sensors with the right choice of electrolyte
Leanne Friedrich, Dirk Gillespie
Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical
Volume 230, July 2016, 281-288

This is just code for scraping data from text files, fitting it,
and plotting it. The original DFT is not included in this repo.

Features include interfaces for creating plots, given a set of plotting
conditions, scraping small bits of information from large data sets,
and ways to use the Mathematica Interpolation function.

Functions are in nf.wl, and interfaces are in interfaces.nb. Note
that this will not run as is, because original data files are not
included in this repo. I'm publishing this as an illustration of
interfaces for plotting and exporting.
